This is a patch to EffMapis' [CruiserSkin](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/EffMapis/CruiserSkin) mod to add the ability to change the wheels, driver's seat, and rear hatch (the small hatch on the wall directly behind the seats, not the back door) texture. The driver's texture the same as the passenger's seat, so now the seats will match.

This is my first venture into C# so I'm unsure of any issues in it 

TODO: 
Now that Cruiser Skin 1.1.0 this functionality is in there, I'll eventually mark this mod as deprecated, let's say by Sept 7. 2025
